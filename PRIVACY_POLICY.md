# Privacy Policy - Chat Memo Extension  

**Last Updated: June 21, 2025**  

Thank you for using the "Chat Memo" browser extension (hereinafter referred to as "the Extension"). We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Extension.  

## 1. Information We Collect  

The core functionality of the Extension is to help you save and manage your conversation history on AI chat websites (e.g., chat.deepseek.com).  

- **AI Chat History:** When you save conversations using the Extension, we collect the chat records (including text content, timestamps, etc.).  
- **Extension Settings:** We may store your preferences, such as interface options or feature configurations.  

**Important Notice:** All collected data is stored locally in your browser's storage. We do not transmit your chat history or any personally identifiable information to our servers or any third-party servers.  

## 2. How We Use Your Information  

The collected information is used solely to provide the Extension’s functionality:  

- **Saving & Displaying Chat History:** Enables you to save, view, search, and manage your AI conversation history.  
- **Exporting Chats:** Allows you to download saved chats as files via your browser’s download function.  
- **Interacting with Specific Websites:** Through the `tabs` permission and host permissions (e.g., `https://chat.deepseek.com/*`), the Extension identifies AI chat pages and interacts with them to capture and manage conversations.  

## 3. Data Storage & Security  

- **Local Storage:** All AI chat records and Extension settings are stored directly on your computer via your browser’s `storage` API. This means data remains on your device unless you manually clear browser storage or uninstall the Extension.  
- **Data Security:** Since data is stored locally, its security depends on your computer and browser’s safeguards. We do not control or access this locally stored data.  

## 4. Information We Do NOT Collect  

We explicitly state that the Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit:  

- Personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email, phone number, etc. (unless such details are part of your chat history, which remains local).  
- Your browsing history (except for AI chat pages directly related to the Extension’s functionality, used locally only).  
- Passwords or sensitive account credentials.  

## 5. Third-Party Services  

- **`jszip.min.js`:** The Extension may include the `jszip.min.js` library for local data processing (e.g., compressing chat records) to optimize storage or exports. This library runs locally in your browser and does not transmit data externally.  

## 6. Permission Explanations  

The Extension requests the following permissions, used only for core features:  

- `storage`: Saves chat history and settings locally in your browser.  
- `tabs`: Identifies and interacts with AI chat tabs to capture content.  
- `downloads`: Enables exporting chats to your computer.  
- `host_permissions` (e.g., `https://chat.deepseek.com/*`): Allows the Extension to run scripts on specified AI chat sites for reading and saving conversations.  

## 7. Your Rights & Choices  

Since all data is stored locally, you have full control:  

- **Access & Modify:** Manage saved chats via the Extension’s interface.  
- **Delete:** Remove all data by clearing the Extension’s storage in your browser or uninstalling it.  

## 8. Changes to This Policy  

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Significant changes will be announced on the Extension’s Chrome Web Store page. Please review this policy periodically.
